# Blou

*Blou is a Discord bot that I'm working on for my own server and a few friends' servers*

The plan is to have it be a jack of many trades, and a master of community and event management.

The main goal for the project is the ability to scrape and aggregate information from custom sources so you and your friends can stay up to date on what's happening in your area.

### <u>Rough Roadmap</u>
- Add user management (mute, timeout, kick, ban, etc)
- Add role management (create roles, add roles, etc)
- Add message filtering
- Add informational commands (weather, traffic, etc.)
- Add event management (user defined, categorized, filterable)
- Add event commands (upcoming, all, past, etc.)

> End goal: custom command framework + source scraping/aggregation
