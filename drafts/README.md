# Hi, I&rsquo;m Eleina! ðŸ‘‹

*or Ellie/El for short!*
I&rsquo;m a solver of puzzles, lover of all music, petter of dogs & cats, explorer of trails, and enjoyer of all art. I have spent most of my time doing IT ops, and am recently diving back into development after being out of practice for nearly a decade.

## What do I get up to?

-   During the day, I&rsquo;m a sysadmin, and at night, I&rsquo;m a developer, homelabber, and security enthusiast.
-   You&rsquo;ll usually find me listening to lots of music or diving into a variety of games!
-   I love to hike and go touch grass, it&rsquo;s quite relaxing and a great way to decompress <:^)
