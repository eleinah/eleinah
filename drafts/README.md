# Hi, I'm Eleina! 👋 \[^/or Ellie/El for short!/\]

I'm a solver of puzzles, lover of all music, petter of dogs & cats,
explorer of trails, and enjoyer of all art. I have spent most of my time
doing IT ops, and am recently diving back into development after being
out of practice for nearly a decade.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Langs:
  - Comfortable & preferred:
    - Python
    - Go *main language of focus*
  - Familiar but don't use much:
    - Lua
    - Bash
  - Limited exposure:
    - Java
    - Lisp
  - Curious about:
    - Rust
    - Elixir
- I'm actively looking to contribute to open source and will update what
  I'm contributing to most here.
- Always looking for fun and exciting new things to work on, please feel
  free to contact me: \`github at lly (dot) email\` if you'd like to
  work together!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What do I get up to?

- During the day, I'm a sysadmin, and at night, I'm a developer,
  homelabber, and security enthusiast.
- You'll usually find me listening to lots of music or diving into a
  variety of games!
- I love to hike and go touch grass, it's quite relaxing and a great way
  to decompress \<:^)
