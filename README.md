  # Goodbye, GitHub!

  I have decided that I will no longer be using and depending on GitHub to host my Git repositories or CI/CD.

  Learn more at [Give Up GitHub](https://giveupgithub.org/) on why and how you should consider doing the same, so we can continue building a truly free and open-source ecosystem, free from proprietary control.

  Moving forward, you can find my work at the following places:
  
  [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/eleina)
  
  [My selfhosted Forgejo](https://git.eleina.dev)
