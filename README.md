### Hi, I'm Eleina! ðŸ‘‹ <sup> *or Ellie/El for short!* </sup>
I'm a solver of puzzles, lover of all music, petter of dogs & cats, explorer of trails, and enjoyer of all art. I have spent most of my time doing IT ops, and am recently diving back into development after being out of practice for nearly a decade.

#### <ins> What do I get up to? </ins>
- During the day, I'm a sysadmin, and at night, I'm a developer, homelabber, and security enthusiast.
- You'll usually find me listening to lots of music or diving into a variety of games!
- I love to hike and go touch grass, it's quite relaxing and a great way to decompress <:^)
